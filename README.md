Objective of the Study
The primary objective of this study is to develop a cost efficient hardware-based vehicle validation system with a dedicated camera by using the vehicle plate number to validate for Ateneo de Zamboanga University that effectively addresses the limitations of the previous Liecap system. This research aims to test a different OCR technology than using Google ML kit V2 with a more advanced and adaptable OCR system, enabling the accurate capture of multiple lines of text from license plates, thus resolving the issue of incomplete data caused by the previous systemâ€™s limitation of capturing only the first line of text and to improve distance of 3 meters ensuring more effective validation at typical vehicle entry points. Furthermore, the study seeks to enhance image pre-processing techniques such as noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and edge detection to handle real-world challenges such as low-light environments, shadows, and dirty plates.

A significant focus of the study is to ensure that the system can reliably recognize and process non-standard plates, such as motorcycle backlog plates and improvised plates, which are commonly found in Zamboanga City. The system will also be designed with the compatibility of different license plate formats, sizes, and positioning used by motorcycles and cars. This adaptability is crucial, particularly for motorcycles, which often feature backlog or improvised plates that do not conform to standard designs.
